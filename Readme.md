A console-based password manager with master password protection and full data encryption.
All credentials are stored in an encrypted file and can only be accessed with the correct master password.

## Features

- Master password (SHA-256 hashed, 3 attempts)
- Full encryption of all data using cryptography.fernet
- Add, view, search, and delete password entries
- Clean console interface with screen clearing
- Data stored in passwords.enc, master password hash in master.hash
